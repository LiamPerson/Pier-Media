A home media center made for use with Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (though should work on other devices)
Connect to your Pier server by going to it's IP address in the browser of your choice. For example in Google Chrome's address bar enter the server's ip address (example: `192.168.8.77/`) or simply go to the device's name which should be by default `raspberrypi/`.
